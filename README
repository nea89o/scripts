Scripts that I tend to use on mostly in desktop environments.

Im planning to expand this, but right now a lot of my scripts are very application specific and/or dependency heavy.

A multimedia capable terminal emulator such as wezterm is probably required for a lot of these things.

jq is a dependency for some of these scripts.


Application scripts:

reddit: a script to show a top image post from reddit
generate-multimc-desktop-files: a perhaps very specific script to generate desktop files for all your multimc instances


Library scripts:

choose: a library script i use to prompt for user input
osc: a library script to execute some OSC escape sequences
readkey: a library script to read a single key and parse key entities
